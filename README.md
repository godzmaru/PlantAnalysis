## Plant Analysis
Plant Analysis is a package composed of modular image processing functions for the determination of quantitative traits from various plant variants. This package is designed to accomodate different type of plant images captured in both visible and near infrared spectrum camera. The package also contains machine learning to detect label for automatic identification and uses Panda module to extract data. It is developed upon open source platforms for plant research.

## Examples:
Below are few examples:

## Motivation
Recent study have shown that the multi-spectral vegetation indices taken from imaging spectroscopy has a strong correlation in measuring the content of chlorophyll and  nitrogen abundance in all variant of cultivars.This project is to emulate this findings and to demonstrate image segmentation to separate plant with background and soil for both visible and NIR images.
